My career journey started with an apprenticeship at the Plansee Group in Reutte, Tyrol, where I gained hands-on experience in tool preparation, stamping, and quality control during the final months of my training. After completing my apprenticeship, I worked at Plansee for an additional two years, further honing my technical skills.

In February, I began attending the Ingenieur Kolleg in Reutte, where I successfully earned my Matura degree and diploma as an automation engineer. Building on this foundation, I pursued a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science at the University of Innsbruck, further expanding my knowledge and expertise in the field.
