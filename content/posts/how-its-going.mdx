My career journey started with an apprenticeship as a process technican at the Plansee Group in Reutte, Tyrol. After completing my apprenticeship, I spent one year at Plansee, gaining experience in stamping, tool preparation, and quality control.
In February 2020, I began attending the Ingenieur Kolleg in Reutte, where I successfully earned my Matura degree and diploma as an automation engineer. Building on this foundation, I have been pursuing a bachelorâ€™s degree in computer science at the University of Innsbruck since October 2022.
